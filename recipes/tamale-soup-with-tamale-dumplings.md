# Tamale Soup with Tamale Dumplings

## Ingredients

### For the Soup:

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 red bell pepper, diced
- 1 green bell pepper, diced
- 1 can (15 oz) diced tomatoes, with juices
- 1 can (15 oz) black beans, drained and rinsed
- 1 cup frozen corn
- 4 cups chicken broth (or vegetable broth for vegetarian)
- 1 teaspoon chili powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon oregano
- Salt and pepper to taste

### For the Tamale Dumplings:

- 1 cup masa harina
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/3 cup chicken or vegetable broth
- 2 tablespoons melted butter (or oil for dairy-free)
- Optional: 1/4 cup shredded cheese (cheddar or Monterey Jack)

### Optional Toppings:

- Fresh cilantro
- Diced avocado
- Crumbled queso fresco
- Lime wedges

## Directions

1. Sauté the Vegetables: Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add diced onion, garlic, and bell peppers. Sauté for 4–5 minutes until the vegetables are softened and aromatic.
2. Build the Base: Add the diced tomatoes (with their juices), black beans, corn, chicken broth, chili powder, cumin, smoked paprika, oregano, salt, and pepper to the pot. Stir to combine and bring to a gentle simmer. Let the soup cook for 15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.
3. Make the Dumpling Dough: While the soup simmers, prepare the tamale dumplings. In a medium bowl, whisk together masa harina, baking powder, and salt. Add the broth and melted butter, mixing until a soft dough forms. If desired, fold in shredded cheese for added flavor.
4. Shape the Dumplings: Using your hands, roll the dough into small, bite-sized balls, about 1 inch in diameter. Set them aside on a plate.
5. Cook the Dumplings: Gently drop the dumplings into the simmering soup one at a time. Cover the pot and let the soup cook for an additional 15–20 minutes, or until the dumplings are firm and cooked through.
6. Serve: Ladle the soup into bowls, ensuring each serving has a generous portion of dumplings. Garnish with cilantro, diced avocado, crumbled queso fresco, and a squeeze of lime for extra flavor.

## Notes

- You can adjust the spiciness of the soup by adding more chili powder or using a spicy variety of salsa.
- For a vegetarian version, use vegetable broth and omit the cheese if you’re looking for a dairy-free option.
