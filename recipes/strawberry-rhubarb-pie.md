# Strawberry Rhubarb Pie

## Ingredients

- 1 recipe All-Butter Pie Crust (2 crusts)
- 1 c. + 2 tbsp. granulated sugar
- 6 Tbsp. cornstarch
- 1/2 tsp. kosher salt
- 1 lb. fresh rhubarb
- 1 lb. strawberries, stemmed and quartered
- 1 Tbsp. orange juice
- 2 tsp. orange zest
- 2 tsp. vanilla bean paste or vanilla extract
- 1 large egg
- 2 Tbsp. turbinado sugar

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 375Â°. Place a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet on the center rack of the oven to preheat.
2. Roll out 1 piece of dough on a floured surface into a 12-inch round, starting at the center and working your way out. (Sprinkle flour over the top of the dough if it's a bit too moist.) Carefully lift the dough and place in a 9-inch pie pan (not deep dish); gently press against the sides of the pan. Trim excess overhanging dough at the edge of the pie plate.
3. Stir together the sugar, cornstarch, and salt in a large bowl until evenly combined. Add the rhubarb, strawberries, orange juice, orange zest, and vanilla. Toss until evenly coated. Pour the fruit mixture into the pie crust.
4. Roll out the other piece of dough into a 12-inch round on a floured surface. Cut into eight 1 1/2-inch-wide strips. Arrange 4 strips of dough in parallel rows on top of the filling. Working with one strip at a time, arrange the remaining 4 strips perpendicular to the first ones, weaving the strips over and under to form a lattice. Trim the ends of the strips and press them against the bottom crust. Press with a fork all around the edge of the pie crust to crimp.
5. In a small bowl, whisk the egg and 1 tablespoon of water with a fork. Brush the dough lightly with the egg wash and sprinkle with the turbinado sugar.
6. Bake the pie until the filling is bubbly and thickened in the middle of the pie, 1 hour 20 minutes to 1 hour 30 minutes. (Cover the pie with foil if the crust is getting too dark after 45 minutes.) Allow the pie to cool to room temperature before slicing, about 4 hours.
