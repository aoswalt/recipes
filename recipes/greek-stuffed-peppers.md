# Greek Stuffed Peppers

Prep Time: 35 mins
Total Time: 1 hr 20 mins

## Ingredients

- 6 bell peppers
- 1 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 lb. boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 1 tsp. dried oregano
- Kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 1 1/2 c. low-sodium chicken stock or water, divided
- 1 c. couscous
- 1 small red onion, chopped
- 1 zucchini, chopped
- 1 clove garlic, finely chopped
- 1 c. quartered cherry tomatoes
- 1/2 c. Kalamata olives, pitted, chopped
- 2 Tbsp. chopped fresh dill
- 1 c. crumbled feta, divided
- Lemon wedges, for serving

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350ยบ. Slice off top of bell peppers. Discard stems and remove ribs and seeds. Arrange peppers upright in a large casserole dish.
2. In a large skillet over medium heat, heat oil. Add chicken and oregano; season with salt and pepper. Cook, turning occasionally, until chicken is golden brown and no longer pink, about 8 minutes per side. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 5 minutes, then finely chop.
3. In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, bring 1 cup stock to a boil. Remove pot from heat. Stir in couscous. Cover pot with a tight-fitting lid. Let sit until couscous is tender and liquid is absorbed, about 5 minutes.
4. Transfer couscous and chicken to a large bowl. Add onion, zucchini, garlic, tomatoes, olives, dill, and 1/2 cup feta; season with salt and pepper and toss to combine.
5. Stuff couscous mixture into peppers. Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup feta. Pour remaining 1/2 cup stock into baking dish (to help peppers steam) and cover with foil.
6. Bake peppers until tender and cheese is melty, 42 to 45 minutes. Serve with lemon wedges alongside.
