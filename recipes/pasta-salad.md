# Pasta Salad

## Ingredients

- 3 cups uncooked fusilli, rotini, etc. pasta
- 2 heaping cups halved cherry tomatoes
- 1 1/2 cups cooked chickpeas, drained and rinsed
- 1 cup crumbled feta cheese
- 1 cup basil leaves, torn
- 1/2 cup minced parsley
- 1/2 cup chopped mint
- 1/2 cup pepperoncini
- 1/2 cup green olives
- 1 red onion, chopped
- 1 bell pepper, chopped
- 12 oz sliced pepperoni and/or salami
- small mozzarella balls or cubed mozzarella
- grated parmesan

### Dressing

- 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, more for drizzling
- 3 tablespoons lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 teaspoon herbes de Provence, or dried Italian seasoning
- 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 3/4 teaspoon sea salt

## Directions

1. Prepare pasta al dente
2. Meanwhile, make the dressing. In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, mustard, garlic, herbes de Provence, red pepper flakes, and salt. (Note: the dressing will have a strong flavor, itâ€™ll mellow once it coats all of the pasta salad ingredients).
3. Drain the pasta and let it cool to room temp. Transfer everything to a large bowl. Pour the dressing and toss to coat. Season to taste with more lemon, salt, pepper, and/or a drizzle of olive oil, if desired, and serve.
