# Lemon Butter Fish Tacos

## Ingredients

- 4 firm white fish fillet about 6 inches long, 1-inch thick (recommend paiche or tilapia)
- 2 Tbsp salted butter melted
- 1 tsp paprika
- 1/2 tsp kosher salt + extra to taste
- zest and juice from 1 lemon
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp onion powder
- 2 Tbsp olive oil
- 3/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper

### Chipotle Cream Sauce

- 1 cup Mexican crema or sour cream
- 1 tsp grated lemon zest
- 2 Tbsp fresh lemon juice
- 1 chipotle pepper in adobo sauce + 1 Tbsp  adobo sauce
- 2 Tbsp water
- 1/2 tsp kosher salt

### Toppings

- pickled red onions
- grated carrots
- avocado slices
- shredded purple cabbage
- sliced jalape√±os
- fresh cilantro
- shredded cabbage
- lime wedges
- lemon wedges
- corn tortillas

## Directions

1. In a small bowl, combine melted butter with olive oil and sea salt, lemon juice, and zest. Stir to combine.
2. In a separate bowl, combine salt, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, and black pepper.
3. Evenly sprinkle spice mixture onto both sides of fish fillets.
4. In a large, heavy pan over medium-high heat, heat olive oil until hot. Cook 2 fish fillets at a time to avoid overcrowding, which allows for even browning. Cook each side 3 to 4 minutes just until fish becomes opaque, feels somewhat firm in the center, and is browned.
5. Lightly drizzle some of the lemon butter sauce as you cook, reserving the rest for serving.
6. Drizzle fish with remaining lemon butter sauce.
7. In a food processor or blender, combine crema, chipotle in adobo and sauce, lemon zest and lemon juice, water, and salt until smooth; transfer to a small bowl.
8. Flake fish with a fork into pieces.
9. Heat corn tortillas on a griddle. Fill with fish pieces and serve tacos with chipotle cream sauce and garnish with toppings of your choice.
