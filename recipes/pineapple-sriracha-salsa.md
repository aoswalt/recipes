# Pineapple Sriracha Salsa

- Prep Time: 15 mins
- Cook Time: 5 mins
- Cool Time: 15 mins
- Chill Time: 1 hr
- Total Time: 1 hr 35 mins

## Ingredients

- 1 (20 ounce) can pineapple chunks in juice
- 1 teaspoon vegetable oil, for greasing pan
- 1/2 yellow onion, roughly chopped
- 6 unpeeled garlic cloves
- 1/4 cup chile garlic sauce (such as Sriracha / Underwood Farms)
- 3 tablespoons fresh mint leaves
- 1/4 teaspoon salt, or to taste
- 1/4 cup seasoned rice vinegar

## Directions

1. Place a strainer over a bowl, and transfer in pineapple chunks. Let drain well, and reserve juice.
2. Preheat the ovenâ€™s broiler to High and set a rack 8 inches from the heat source. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil, and lightly oil the foil.
3. Spread pineapple chunks onto the prepared pan. Add onion and garlic and spread out evenly.
4. Broil pineapple until tops of pineapple chunks and onions are charred, about 5 minutes. Let cool to room temperature, about 15 minutes.
5. Remove garlic cloves and set aside. Transfer pineapple and onions into a blender. Peel garlic cloves; add to the blender; add in reserved pineapple juice, Sriracha, mint leaves, salt, and vinegar. Blend until the mixture is as smooth or chunky as you like. Taste for seasoning.
6. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving. Salsa can be made up to 3 days ahead.
