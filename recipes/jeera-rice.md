# Jeera Rice

## Ingredients

- 1 cup Long grain basmati rice
- 1.5 cups Water
- Salt to taste
- 2 Ghee
- 1 tsp Cumin seeds
- 2 Cardamom pods
- 3 Cloves
- 2 Green chilies (optional)
- 1 Bay leaf

## Directions

1. Wash the basmati rice thoroughly in running water for 4 to 5 times or until the water turns clear. Drain and set it aside.
2. Press the “Sauté” button on the Instant Pot. Once the display shows “Hot”, add ghee to it, followed by cumin seeds. Let the cumin seeds splutter, then add bay leaf, sliced green chili, cloves, and green cardamom. Fry for a few seconds.
3. Add the washed basmati rice to the pot and stir it with the spices for 30 seconds.
4. Add water and salt to the pot and give it a quick stir.
5. Close the Instant Pot lid and press the “Manual/Pressure Cook” button. Cook on high pressure for 5 minutes with the pressure valve in the sealing position.
6. Once the cooking time is up, let the pressure release naturally for 2 minutes, and then do a quick pressure release by turning the pressure valve to the venting position.
7. Open the lid of the Instant Pot and fluff the rice with a fork.
