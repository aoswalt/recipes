# Drunken Noodles

## Ingredients

– 8 oz wide rice noodles
– 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
– 3 cloves garlic, minced
– 1 small onion, sliced
– 1 bell pepper, sliced (any color)
– 1 cup chicken breast, thinly sliced
– 2-3 Thai bird chilies, sliced (adjust to taste)
– 1 cup Thai basil leaves
– 2 tablespoons soy sauce
– 1 tablespoon dark soy sauce
– 1 tablespoon oyster sauce
– 1 tablespoon fish sauce
– 1 tablespoon sugar
– Fresh lime wedges for serving

## Directions

1. **Prepare the Noodles**: Soak the rice noodles in hot water for about 30 minutes until softened. Drain and set aside.
2. **Cook the Chicken**: In a large skillet or wok, heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Add the minced garlic and sliced onions, sautéing until fragrant and slightly golden.
3. **Add Veggies and Chicken**: Incorporate the sliced bell pepper and thinly sliced chicken breast into the skillet. Stir-fry until the chicken is cooked through.
4. **Incorporate Noodles**: Add the soaked rice noodles into the skillet along with the sliced Thai bird chilies. Toss everything together to combine.
5. **Sauce It Up**: Pour in soy sauce, dark soy sauce, oyster sauce, fish sauce, and sugar. Stir-fry for an additional 2-3 minutes, allowing the noodles to absorb the flavors.
6. **Add Basil**: Finally, add the Thai basil leaves and give everything a good toss just until the basil wilts.
7. **Serve**: Plate the Drunken Noodles and serve with lime wedges on the side to squeeze over before eating.
