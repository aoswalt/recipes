# Zucchini Mushroom Stir Fry

## Ingredients

### Vegetables

- 2 medium zucchinis sliced and halved
- 2 medium carrots sliced
- 1 cup mushroom sliced
- 1/4 cup oil for stir-frying
- 1 clove of garlic minced
- Salt to taste

### Teriyaki Sauce

- 1/3 cup coconut aminos
- 1 tbsp rice vinegar
- 1 tbsp arrowroot flour
- 1 tbsp sesame oil
- 3 - 4 tbsp freshly squeezed orange juice about 1/2 an orange

## Instructions

1. Preheat a large pan/skillet on medium then low heat with oil and sauté carrots for 2-3 minutes until slightly softened.
2. Then add zucchini, mushroom and minced garlic. Sauté for another 8-10 minutes - until vegetables are soft (but not wilted)
3. In a small bowl, mix together all the ingredients for the Teriyaki sauce. Set aside.
4. When vegetables are done, add sauce and cook on heat for about 1 minute. The sauce should thicken at that time. Serve over rice and enjoy!
5. Stir gently until the sauce becomes sticky and thoroughly coat the veggie stir fry.
6. Serve with a bed of rice or your favorite protein of choice.

## Notes

- When adding salt to taste, keep in mind that coconut aminos is salty itself.
