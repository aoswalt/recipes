# Queso / Cheese Sauce

## Ingredients

- 265 g water
- 11 g sodium citrate
- 285 g cheese

## Directions

1. Mix water and sodium citrate in a pot, whisking to dissolve
2. Heat over medium heat until simmering
3. Gradually add cheese, whisking each addition until smooth

## Notes

- Can substitute beer or other liquid for water
- Cheese suggestions: pepper jack, monterey jack, cheddar
- Can add additions such as jalapenos
- Immersion blender can help blend cheese instead of a whisk
- If the emulsion breaks, bring the mixture to a full boil and then continue processing it with the immersion blender. The mixture should pull together. If this fails, add a spoonful of heavy cream and try again.
- The cheese will thicken slightly as it cools.
