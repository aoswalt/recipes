# Mushroom Jerky

- Prep time: 15 minutes
- Cook time: 2 hours

## Ingredients

- 8 ounces shiitake mushrooms
- 1/4 cup coconut aminos or low sodium soy sauce
- 2 teaspoons rice wine vinegar
- 1/2 tablespoon chili garlic paste (Sambal Olek or Sriracha)
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon smoke paprika
- 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/4 teaspoon onion powder

## Directions

1. Remove the stems from the mushrooms. Slice or tear the mushroom caps into desired size. Remember, the mushrooms will shrink about 40-50% during the cooking process. Prep accordingly.
2. Mix coconut aminos, rice wine vinegar, chili garlic paste, sesame oil, smoked paprika, and black pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder in a bowl or plastic bag. Add the mushrooms to a bowl or bag and mix well. Refrigerate for a minimum of 30 minutes and up to 24 hours.
3. Preheat the oven to the lowest temperature possible (minimum of 250°F).
4. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Transfer mushrooms to baking sheets. When transferring mushrooms allow excess marinade to drip off before adding to the pan.
5. Cook for one hour. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and flip mushrooms. Cook for an additional hour or depending on the size of the mushrooms and your desired finished texture.
6. Let cool.

## Notes

- Probably want to double or triple the recipe
- Portabella mushrooms also work well, especially for a more jerky-like texture
