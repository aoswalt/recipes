# Paleo Beef Empanadas

Total: 1 h 15 m

## Ingredients

### Crust

- 2 cups almond meal
- 1/2 cup tapioca flour
- 1 teaspoon sea salt
- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 2 large eggs
- 3 tablespoons Olive Oil
- Coconut flour for dusting

### Beef Empanadas

- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1/2 yellow onion, chopped
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 pound lean ground beef or pork
- 1 teaspoon cumin
- 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 2 tomatoes, diced
- 1 teaspoon sea salt
- 1 can (3 oz.) green chilies, drained, chopped
- 1 large egg
- Coconut oil, if frying

## Directions

1. Start by preparing the pastry. In a large bowl add almond flour, tapioca flour, salt and baking soda. Using a fork mix well.
2. In a separate bowl whisk the eggs then add to the flour and combing together. Slowly add the olive oil until you can form a ball with the mixture.
3. Roll in clear plastic wrap and put in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
4. Heat a large sauté pan and add butter, add onion, garlic and cook until tender. Add beef, cumin, cayenne pepper and garlic then sauté until brown.
5. Add tomato, chilies, and sea salt stirring occasionally about 20 minutes or until liquid evaporated. Remove from heat.
6. Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
7. In a small bowl whisk the egg with 1 teaspoon of water and have a pastry brush handy.
8. Divide pastry into 10 pieces on lightly floured (almond meal or coconut flour) surface, roll each piece into a 6 inch round. Place about 3 tablespoons of filling in one half of each round, fold over other half.
9. Using your fingers or a fork, press edges together. Using a sharp knife add a few slits on top of each empanada, brush with egg.
10. Bake 20 to 25 minutes or until golden brown or you can deep fry using coconut oil until brown.

## Notes

- Use a large biscuit cutter so the Paleo beef empanadas would all come out the same size
- Works great with shredded roasted chicken too
