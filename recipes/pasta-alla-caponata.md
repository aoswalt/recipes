# Pasta Alla Caponata

- Prep Time: 20 mins
- Cook Time: 30 mins
- Stand Time: 20 mins
- Total Time: 1 hr 10 mins

## Ingredients

- 2 (12 ounce) eggplants
- 1 tablespoon kosher salt
- 8 ounces mezze rigatoni, or other dry short pasta
- 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic, peeled, lightly crushed
- 1/2 yellow onion, diced
- 1 large red bell pepper, diced
- 1 rib celery, diced
- 1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste
- 2 tablespoons pine nuts
- 1 pinch red pepper flakes, or more to taste
- 1 tablespoon capers
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
- 2 cups crushed tomatoes
- 8 basil leaves, torn
- 1/2 cup grated pecorino cheese

## Directions

1. Peel off half the eggplant skin in strips using a peeler, and cut eggplant into 1/2-inch cubes. Add eggplant cubes to a large bowl and sprinkle over 1 tablespoon kosher salt; toss thoroughly. Let sit for 20 minutes on the counter, tossing occasionally. Transfer into a strainer, rinse lightly with cold water, and drain very well.
2. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Cook rigatoni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.
3. Add oil to a skillet and place over medium heat. Add garlic cloves; when they start to sizzle, swirl the oil for about 30 seconds. Remove garlic and set aside.
4. Turn the heat to high, and add eggplant to the skillet. Cook, stirring, until eggplant loses its firmness and just starts to become tender, about 6 minutes. Turn off the heat. Set a strainer over a bowl; transfer eggplant into the strainer. Pour any olive oil that drains into the bowl back into the skillet, and place skillet back over medium-high heat.
5. Add onions, celery, and peppers to the skillet, and cook and stir for a few minutes until onions are translucent, and vegetables begin to soften. Add pinenuts, red pepper flakes, capers, and reserved garlic cloves, and cook and stir for 1 minute more.
6. Stir in sugar and vinegar; cook, stirring for another minute. Add eggplant back into the skillet; cook and stir until eggplant is almost tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Add crushed tomatoes and a small splash of water, and cook, stirring for about 3 minutes. Reduce heat to low.
7. Transfer cooked pasta with a strainer into the finished sauce. Add a ladle or 2 of pasta water as needed to thin the sauce. Turn off the heat, and stir in torn basil leaves. Grate a small amount of pecorino on top to serve.
