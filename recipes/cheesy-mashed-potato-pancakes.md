# Cheesy Mashed Potato Pancakes

A great way to use up leftover mashed potatoes

## Ingredients

- 4 cups mashed potatoes
- 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese (8 oz)
- 1 large egg
- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour or up to 1/2 cup flour for creamier potatoes
- 2 1/2 Tbsp chives chopped
- 1/2 cup plain bread crumbs
- 2 Tbsp Light Olive oil or Canola oil to sauté
- Sour cream to serve

## Instructions

### Mashed Potatoes:

1. Fill a 5 Qt pot with water. Add 1 Tbsp salt and peeled quartered russet potatoes (2 lbs or about 7 medium potatoes, peeled and quartered). Cook until easily pierced with fork. Drain well and mash in 4 Tbsp butter then let cool to room temp. Mashed potatoes can be made 1 - 3 days ahead.

### Mashed Potato Pancakes:

1. In a large mixing bowl, combine 4 cups mashed potatoes, 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, 1 large egg, 1/4 cup flour and 2 Tbsp chopped chives. Use a potato masher to mash the mixture together until well mixed. If the potatoes are too loose to hold a patty shape, add flour a Tablespoon at a time.
2. Place a heaping tablespoonful of potato mixture between your palms and form into a round, 1/3" thick patty. Dredge both sides of the pancake in bread crumbs and set on a cutting board. Repeat with remaining pancakes.
3. Heat a large non-stick pan over medium heat with enough oil to lightly cover the bottom of the pan. Once oil is hot, add patties in a single layer and sauté 3-4 minutes per side or until golden brown. Repeat with remaining patties, adding more oil as needed. I usually have 2 skillets going at once to finish sooner.

## Notes

- Recipe works best with mashed potatoes that aren't super creamy. If they are very moist, you may need a little more flour for them to hold a patty shape. Do not use instant mashed potatoes.
- Use dill if you don't have chives!
