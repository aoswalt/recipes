- 1 package 12 ounces sundubu (extra soft/silken tofu)
- 1/3 cup thinly sliced kimchi
- 3 ounces pork or beef
- 1 to 3 teaspoons red chili pepper flakes gochugaru, add more for a spicier stew
- 1 teaspoon minced garlic

## Instructions

1. Cut the meat and kimchi into small thin strips. Add the kimchi, meat, red chili pepper flakes, garlic and sesame oil to a small pot, and place it over medium heat.
2. Stir-fry until the meat is almost cooked, 3 - 4 minutes.
3. Pour in water (or broth) and the juice from the kimchi. Bring it to a boil, and continue to boil for 3 - 4 minutes. Skim off the scum.
4. Add the soft tofu in big chunks. Stir in the salted shrimp or salt to taste (start with 1/4 teaspoon) and black pepper. Cook for 4 -5 minutes. Add the chopped scallion just before removing the pot from the heat. If desired, crack an egg into the stew to serve while itâ€™s still boiling hot.
