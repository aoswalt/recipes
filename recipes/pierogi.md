# Pierogi

- Prep Time 10 minutes
- Cook Time 30 minutes
- Total Time 40 minutes

## Ingredients

### For the potato cheese filling (makes enough for about 2 dozen):

- 1 pound Russet potatoes
- 1 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese (about 4 oz.)
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon pepper

### For the pot cheese filling (makes enough for about 2 dozen):

- 7.5 oz. farmers cheese
- 1 egg yolk
- 1/8 teaspoon salt

### For the pierogi (makes enough for about 2 dozen):

- 1 1/2 cups (222 grams) 1:1 gluten free flour (I use Bob’s Red Mill but other brands should work fine, see Notes.)
- 1/2 cup tapioca starch
- 1 teaspoon xanthan gum
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 large egg
- 1/4 cup sour cream
- About 1/3-1/2 cup warm water

## Directions

### For the potato cheese filling:

1. Wash and peel the potatoes, and cut them into large chunks. Place in a pot and cover with cold water. Cover and bring to a boil, and boil for 10-12 minutes or until the potatoes are fork tender.
2. Drain the water off, return the potatoes to the pot, giving them a few minutes for the excess moisture to evaporate off.
3. Add the cheese, salt, and pepper to the potatoes, and cover the pot for a few minutes to allow the cheese to melt.
4. Using a potato masher and spatula, mash and stir the potatoes to incorporate the cheese. It's fine if there are still a few lumps.
5. Place potato mixture in the refrigerator until cooled completely, and ready to use.

### For the pot cheese filling:

1. Combine the farmers cheese, egg yolk and salt in a bowl and stir until well mixed.
2. Cover and keep in the refrigerator until ready to use.

### For the pierogi:

1. Whisk the gluten free flour, tapioca starch, xanthan gum, and salt together in a large bowl, and make a well in the middle.
2. Place the eggs and sour cream into the well. Using your fingers, gradually work the flour into the eggs and sour cream until you have a crumbly mixture.
3. Slowly pour in the water while working it into the flour mixture with your hands, starting with about 1⁄4 cup, then adding more gradually as you bring the dough together. You will think you haven't added enough, but as you work the dough, it will come together. So it is better to add the water very slowly.
4. Once the dough comes together, knead it until it is fairly smooth and elastic, and slightly damp, but not loose. You can wet your fingers to work in a little more water at a time, as needed.
5. Form the dough into a ball, cover with plastic wrap, and let rest in the refrigerator for about 10 minutes (do not let it rest more than about 30 minutes).
6. Using about a quarter of the dough a ta time, roll it out very thin on a silicone baking mat, about 1/8" thick. You can lightly dust the surface with a little tapioca starch, only if needed. Cut circles about 3-3 1/2 in. in diameter.
7. Place about 1 tablespoon of the desired filling offset from the middle of the circle, fold the circle over, and press the edges together with your fingers, then use a fork to seal completely. Place the formed pierogi on a parchment-lined sheet pan.
8. Repeat with the remaining dough, gathering the scraps to roll a second time to get a full 2 dozen. Do not roll more than twice, as the dough gets dry and tough.
9. Bring a shallow pan of water to a gentle simmer(do not boil).
10. Depending on the size of your pan, add about 4-8 pierogi at a time, stirring gently to keep them from sticking to the bottom and each other. Do not overcrowd your pan. Simmer for about 15 minutes. They will be floating when they are done.
11. Remove from the simmering water, and place in a baking pan or on a sheet pan sprayed with cooking spray, and top with some small bits of butter to keep them from sticking.
12. Continue until you have boiled all of the pierogies. You can cook and serve them immediately or store in the refrigerator for up to 3 to 4 days, or freeze them for up to 2 months.

### Cooking and serving pierogi:

1. Stovetop: Melt butter in a pan and saute onions, if desired. Add the pierogi and saute until heated through. You can cook them until browned and crispy, if desired, or keep them soft and just lightly golden.
2. Oven: Preheat the oven to 350°F. Place the pierogi in a baking pan and top with slices of butter. Add sliced onion, if desired. Baked at 350°F for 20-30 minutes, gently tossing after 10-15 minutes, until heated through.

## Notes

-  Each filling makes enough for about 2 dozen pierogi, and the dough makes enough for about 2 dozen, as well. If you want to make each filling or make more than 2 dozen, I recommend working with one batch of dough at a time. It dries out easily, and gets harder to handle and knead if you are working with more.
- If you are doubling the pot cheese filling, you can use 2 packages of farmers cheese and one whole egg. You don’t have to use two yolks.
- The fillings can be made up to a day in advance and refrigerated until needed. I do not recommend making the dough the night before, as it can dry out.
- While you do need to use the tapioca starch and extra xanthan gum to get a stretch dough that can be handled and rolled, you can likely use different brands of 1:1 flour, just adding the water slowly and adjusting to reach the right consistency.
