# Sweet & Spicy Bacon Chicken

- Cook Time: 40 minutes

## Ingredients

- 4 chicken breasts cut in thirds (12 pieces)
- Bacon slices
- salt and pepper to taste
- garlic powder
- chili powder
- brown sugar

## Directions

1. Cut each breast into 3 pieces, season all the chicken with the spices, then wrap a bacon slice around each piece, roll in brown sugar and place into an oven proof dish....make sure you have some olive oil in the dish too, like 2 or 3 tablespoons is fine.
2. Bake at 400 degrees for 30 to 40 minutes or until chicken is cooked through and bacon is nice and brown and crispy.  Delicious served with mashed potatoes with some of the gravy from the chicken drizzled on top.

## Notes

**Also great on the grill!  No juices to drizzle on anything, but still delicious!
