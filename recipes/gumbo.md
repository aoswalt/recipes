# Gumbo

- Cook Time: 4 hours

## Ingredients

- 3 cups chopped onion
- 1 1/2 cups chopped celery
- 1 1/2 cups chopped green bell pepper
- 6 tablespoons butter or olive oil
- 1 1/3 cups water chicken broth, vegetable broth, beef broth, or seafood stock, divided
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2/3 cup tapioca flour, arrowroot flour, or corn starch
- 6 cloves garlic
- 2 bay leaves
- 8 cups chicken stock
- 1 lb andouille sausage, cut into coins (or smoked kielbasa)
- 1 lb boneless, skinless, chicken thighs
- Kosher salt
- freshly ground black pepper
- 1/2 tbsp cayenne pepper
- 1 tbsp smoked paprika
- Cooked white rice, for serving
- Sliced scallions, for garnish

## Directions

1. Place the chopped Cajun trinity in the bottom of a cast iron skillet or Dutch oven.
2. Top with cold butter.
3. Cook over medium high heat. After 5 minutes, stir the melting butter into the trinity.
4. Continue to cook down the veggies, stirring every 5 minutes.
5. After about 14 minutes, when the trinity starts to brown, start to stir it about every 3 minutes, just to ensure that it does not stick to the bottom of the Dutch oven and burn.
6. Make the tapioca, arrowroot, or corn starch starch slurry by whisking the starch with 2/3 cup of the water or broth. Get the salt ready. Set both aside.
7. When the trinity caramelizes at about the 24 to 28-minute mark, add the minced garlic and sprinkle the salt over the top. Wait about 45 seconds, then stir.
8. Add the other 2/3 cup of water or broth to the mixture. Let steam for 15 to 30 seconds, then stir.
9. Whisk in the tapioca starch slurry, and add the remaining cup of water or broth. Whisk for at least 2 minutes over the medium-high fire, or until all lumps are removed. Use another cup of broth or water, if you need to, to keep the roux wet enough to whisk all starchy lumps out, if necessary.
10. Add beer and stir it in and whisk to prevent the mixture from becoming clumpy. Then, add chicken stock and whisk using the same procedure as the beer.
11. Cut sausage into coins.
12. Add kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to both sides of of boneless, skinless chicken thighs. Sear the chicken thighs in a smoking hot pan with oil.
13. Add cayenne pepper and a pinch of salt to the roux.
14. Turn the stovetop temperature to the lowest simmer possible and add a generous amount of black pepper to the roux. Then, add smoked paprika and stir.
15. After browning the chicken, add it straight to the pot along with the chopped up sausage.
16. Bring the roux to a bare simmer, cover it, and let sit for a couple of hours.
17. Serve with cooked white rice, garnish with scallions, and enjoy!
