# Wild Rice and Mushroom Soup

Prep Time: 15 minutes minutes
Cook Time: 1 hour hour 10 minutes minutes
Total Time: 1 hour hour 25 minutes minutes

## Ingredients

- 2 Tbsp. olive oil
- 2 Tbsp. unsalted butter
- 1 yellow onion, finely chopped
- 3/4 cup finely chopped carrots
- 1/2 cup finely chopped celery
- 8 oz. baby bella (cremini) mushrooms, sliced
- 4 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 cup dry wild rice blend (such as Lundberg brand)
- 1 Tbsp. poultry seasoning (sub Herbs De Provence)
- 1 tsp. kosher salt
- 1/2 tsp. black pepper
- 4 cups (1 quart) lower sodium vegetable broth
- 2/3 cup heavy cream (sub cashew cream*)
- 1/3 cup finely grated Parmesan cheese

## Directions

1. Measure out heavy cream and let it sit at room temperature while you prepare soup. Or, prepare cashew cream, if using (see notes for instructions).
2. Heat oil and butter in a large stockpot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the onion, carrots, and celery, and cook for 8 minutes, or until softened.
3. Add mushrooms and garlic, and stir to combine. Cook for 6 to 8 minutes, stirring only occasionally, until the mushrooms are soft and slightly golden.
4. Add rice and stir to coat. Let the rice cook for 1 to 2 minutes to lightly toast the grains. Stir in poultry seasoning, salt, and pepper.
5. Add broth and 1 cup of water; stir well. Bring the mixture to a low boil, cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for 45 to 60 minutes, or until the rice is tender.
6. Remove the lid and stir in the heavy cream (or cashew cream). Gradually sprinkle in the Parmesan cheese, stirring continuously to avoid clumping, until all is combined. Remove from heat and ladle into bowls.

## Notes

- To make homemade cashew cream, pour 2/3 cup boiling water over 1/3 cup raw cashews. Let sit while the soup cooks. When ready to stir in the cream, transfer mixture to a blender and blend until smooth. Pour cashew cream into soup and stir well to combine.
