# Chicken Cordon Bleu Casserole

- Prep Time: 15 mins
- Cook Time: 25 mins
- Rest Time: 5 mins
- Total Time: 45 mins

## Ingredients

### Crumb Topping

- 2 cup panko breadcrumbs
- 12 tablespoons (168 g) unsalted butter
- 2 tablespoons finely grated Parmesan cheese
- 1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper

### Chicken

- 6 large skinless, boneless chicken breast (about 8 ounces)
- 3/4 teaspoon salt
- 3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1/2 tsp pinch cayenne pepper
- 1/2 tsp pinch fresh thyme leaves
- 3/4 cup heavy cream
- 6 rounded teaspoon Dijon mustard
- 6 ounce diced smoked ham
- 6 ounce Gruyere cheese, grated

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. For topping, place panko in a small bowl; add in butter, Parmesan, and season with pepper. Stir together until evenly combined and mixture resembles coarse sand; set aside.
3. Cut  chicken into 1/2-inch cubes and transfer into a bowl. Season with salt, black pepper, cayenne, thyme, and salt. Add cream, Dijon, ham, and 2/3 of the grated Gruyere. Stir to combine, and transfer into a 9x13 baking dish. Top evenly with remaining 1/3 of the cheese.
4. Spoon crumb mixture evenly over the top. Poke crumbs down lightly into the chicken mixture with the tip of the spoon before evening out the top.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is cooked through, the casserole is bubbling around the edges, and the top is nicely browned, about 25 minutes. Let rest for 5 minutes before serving.
