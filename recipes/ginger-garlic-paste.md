# Ginger Garlic Paste

Time: 30 minutes

## Ingredients

- 125 grams ginger (4.5 Ounce, refer notes)
- 125 grams garlic (4.5 Ounce, peeled)
- 1 tablespoon oil (I use organic refined coconut oil)
- 1/2 teaspoon Turmeric (or haldi / optional)

## Directions

1. Peel and chop ginger into 1 inch pieces
2. Add ginger, garlic and oil to a grinder/ blender jar. Blend well until smooth and light in color. Scrape off the sides and repeat blending until you see a smooth mixture.
3. Transfer the ginger garlic paste to a clean dry glass jar. Refrigerate ginger garlic paste up to a month or 6 months in a freezer.
4. To Freeze, transfer to ice tray and knock the tray to the counter a few times. Cover with a cling wrap. Once set transfer them to a ziplock bag. Use as desired whenever needed by defrosting one cube each time.

## Notes

- You may start with lesser amounts of ginger and add as required to suit your taste.
- There are many kinds of ginger and they differ in flavor and strength. Run a small test batch to make ginger garlic paste.  Cook with it first. If it is too gingery, add more garlic and blend. If it is too garlicy, add more ginger and blend. Note down the additions so you know the exact amounts that work well for you.
