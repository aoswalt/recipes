# Mexican Street Corn Dip

- Prep Time: 20 mins
- Cook Time: 5 mins
- Additional Time: 1 hr
- Total Time: 1 hr 25 mins

## Ingredients

- 4 ears sweet corn
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, or to taste
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons chili powder, or to taste
- 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano, preferably Mexican oregano
- 1/2 cup minced red onion plus more for garnish
- 4 ounces softened cream cheese
- 1/2 cup mayonnaise
- 1/3 cup sour cream
- 1/2 cup finely grated Mexican cotija cheese or finely grated Parmesan cheese
- 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 lime juiced, plus more to taste
- 1/3 cup chopped cilantro plus more for garnish

### Garlic Fresno Chili Oil (optional)

- 1/2 cup avocado oil
- 2 cloves garlic, peeled
- 1 red Fresno chili, seeded and sliced
- 1 pinch salt
- 1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika

## Directions

1. Slice corn kernels from corn cobs into a bowl; set aside.
2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat and add corn once the oil is hot. Press and pat down into an even layer, and let cook for about 2 minutes without stirring, until the corn begins to brown and starts to pop.
3. Add salt, cayenne, black pepper, chili powder, oregano, and red onion. Cook, stirring, until corn is no longer raw but not yet beginning to soften, about 2 minutes. Turn off the heat, and let cool to room temperature in the pan.
4. Add cream cheese, mayonnaise, sour cream, cotija cheese, and garlic powder to a bowl; stir together with a spatula until combined. Add corn mixture, lime juice, and cilantro; stir until evenly combined. Cover and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, at least 1 hour.
5. Meanwhile, for the garlic fresno chili oil combine avocado oil, garlic, Fresno chili, salt, and smoked paprika in a blender cup; blend until very smooth. Strain through a fine mesh sieve into a small bowl and reserve until needed. This will make more than you will need, and the extra chili oil can be stored in the refrigerator to use in other recipes.
6. Remove dip from the refrigerator, stir, and taste for seasoning. Squeeze in more fresh lime juice, and add more salt if needed. Stir and transfer into a serving bowl. Sprinkle the top with a little grated cotija cheese, drizzle with 1 to 2 tablespoons garlic chili oil, and more diced red onion and chopped cilantro if desired.
