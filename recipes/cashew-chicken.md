# Cashew Chicken

## Ingredients

- 1 inch of fresh ginger thinly sliced
- 2 cloves of garlic minced
- 2 - 3 tbsp avocado oil
- 1/4 cup onion chopped
- 2/3 cup raw cashews divided

### Chicken Marinade

- 1.5 lbs chicken breast or thighs
- 2 tbsp coconut aminos
- 1 heaping tbsp arrowroot starch
- Salt to taste

### Sauce

- 3 tbsp coconut aminos
- 2 tsp sesame oil
- 2 tbsp rice vinegar
- 1 pinch of red pepper flakes
- 3 tbsp cashew butter
- 1 - 2 tbsp honey Optional
- 1/4 cup filtered water

## Instructions

1. Cut the chicken into cubes. In a big Ziploc bag or medium bowl, marinate the chicken with coconut amino, salt, and arrowroot flour. Make sure the chicken is completely coated.
2. In a small bowl, whisk together the ingredients for the sauce - coconut aminos, water, sesame oil, rice vinegar, cashew butter, red pepper flakes, honey (if using any). Set aside.
3. Toast the cashews on medium heat for a couple of minutes.
4. In a wide pan, heat up 1 - 2 tbsp oil in an instant pot. Add onion and garlic, saute until fragrant. Add additional 1 - 2 oil if needed ( I used extra 2 - 3 tbsp oil to prevent the chicken from sticking) then add chicken cubes. Flip a couple of times until the chicken is slightly browned on the outside.
5. Stir in the sauce, garlic, ginger and half of of the cashews. Make sure the chicken is evenly coated.
6. Cover and simmer for 10 minutes.
7. Uncover and simmer for another 5 minutes to thicken sauce.
8. Stir in the remaining cashews
9. Following an optional step: mix 1 tbsp filtered water with 1 tbsp arrowroot flour. Add into the cashew chicken and incorporate well.

## Notes

- Coconut amino itself is salty, so take that into consideration when you salt the chicken.
- I personally prefer pre-sear the chicken in a separate non-stick pan before adding it to the instant pot. Depending on the type of instant pot you are using, the arrowroot starch in chicken marinate may create a sticky layer on the bottom of the pot.
- Stir in 1 tbsp arrowroot flour mixed with 2 tbsp of water at the end if you prefer a thicker sauce. Stir well until the sauce thickens.
- There will likely be a sticky layer on the bottom of the instant pot after cooking, it is due to the arrowroot starch. Use a wooden spatula to scrape and stir the chicken gently before serving.
