# Pork Vindaloo

- Prep: 15 m
- Cook: 45 m
- Ready: 1 h

## Ingredients

- 12-14 cloves garlic
- 1 tbsp. hot paprika
- 1 tbsp. sweet paprika
- 1 tsp. brown mustard seeds
- 1 tbsp. sugar
- 2 tsp. kosher salt
- 2 tbsp. tomato paste
- 1/2 cup distilled white vinegar
- 1/4 cup canola oil
- 1 medium red onion, chopped (1 1/2 cups)
- 1/2 tsp. crushed red chile flakes
- 2 lb. pork shoulder, cut into 1/2-inch pieces (5 cups)

## Instructions

1. Make the sauce: In a food processor or blender, combine the garlic, both paprikas, mustard seeds, sugar, salt, tomato paste, vinegar, and 1/4 cup water; purée until smooth.
2. In a large cast-iron skillet, heat the oil over medium-high. Add the onion and chile flakes, and cook, stirring, until the onion is golden brown, about 5–6 minutes.
3. Add the pork and the puréed sauce. Stir well to coat the pork, cover, reduce heat to low, and cook until the pork is falling apart and the sauce is thick and lush, about 45 minutes.
