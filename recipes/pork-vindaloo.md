# Pork Vindaloo

- Prep: 15 m
- Cook: 45 m
- Ready: 1 h

## Ingredients

- 5 to 10 large garlic cloves, peeled
- 1 2-inch piece ginger, peeled and coarsely chopped
- 2 tablespoons cider vinegar
- 1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 tablespoon Indian red chili powder (see note) or red pepper flakes
- 1 tablespoon Kashmiri red chili powder (see note) or Hungarian hot paprika
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt
- 2 pounds pork shoulder, trimmed of excess fat and cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces
- 1 inch wide ball of tamarind pulp (see note)
- 1/4 cup olive oil or vegetable oil
- 1 3-inch cinnamon stick
- 5 cloves
- 4 green cardamom pods (see note)
- 1 teaspoon black mustard seeds, coarsely crushed (see note)
- 1 cup finely chopped onion
- 1 large red bell pepper, cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces
- Cooked rice for serving

## Instructions

1. In a food processor or blender, mince garlic and ginger. Add vinegar, turmeric, cumin, chili powders and salt and blend well. Transfer to a large bowl, add pork and turn to coat well. Cover and set aside at room temperature for one hour.
2. Place tamarind in a bowl with one cup hot water. When cool enough to handle, crush tamarind with fingers to extract pulp clinging to fibers. Add another cup of hot water and mix well. Strain into a clean bowl, discarding fibrous residue.
3. In a large saut√© pan, combine oil, cinnamon, cloves, cardamom and mustard seeds. Fry over medium-high heat until sizzling and aromatic, about 4 minutes. Add onion and cook, stirring often, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add pork and cook, turning until lightly browned, about 6 minutes.
4. Add tamarind juice and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and cook until pork is tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Add bell pepper and cook 7 minutes. Serve with rice.

## Notes

- Excellent vindaloo recipe. I increased the mustard seeds to about 1.5 tsp and used tamarind concentrate instead of squeezing the tamarind pulp. It worked very well. I also added some partially-boiled potato chunks at Step 4 -- the potatoes absorb the flavor of the sauce and are delicious. They also help thicken the sauce a little.
- Kashmiri chili powder has a bright red color but is not so hot. Indian chili powder is hotter but has less fiery color. Using a mix of sweet Hungarian paprika and hot cayenne pepper or Indian chili powder is a good substitute for Kashmiri chili powder.
- 1 Tbl of Tamarind concentrate per cup of water so in this case 2 Tbl total.
